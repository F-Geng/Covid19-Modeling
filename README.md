## This is a study using data, regression analysis and machine learning to understand auto-catalytic systems.  While the subject is Covid-19 case growth, the approach can be applied to any changing systems, such as the changing public opinion, consumer acceptance of a new product after launch, sales performance over the years, etc. 
## The question to ask: During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, what make one country perform better than another?  
## The goal: Prescriptive analysis of the socioeconomical and demographical factors, as well as disease control measures that point to actions to curb the pandemic. 
## Study outline:
### First, we create a mathematical model describing the Covid-19 case number changes over time, based on the domain knowledge of chemical reaction kinetics.
### Next, using Covid-19 case number data, we find out the model parameters for each country by fitting that country's case number data to the general mathematical model.  Thus a country's model parameters are unique descriptors of the epidemic development in that country.
### Now we use machine learning technique to find out what socioeconomical and demographical factors, as well as disease control measures, are most responsible for these inter-country differences. These findings prescribe the actions to be taken for effective pandemic control.
